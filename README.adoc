# Generate Device Report

## Currently Cisco IOS
* This will run specific Cisco IOS Comands and then generate a text repoort for each device.
* The ansible.cfg and hosts files will need to be modified for speccific environments
* The hosts file has username and ssh key defined for device access.  You will need to change to username/password most likely.

|NOTE:|
DO NOT store real username and passwords in any of these files.
